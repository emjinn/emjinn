### Hi, I'm Emily! 

I'm an undergraduate student at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/), pursuing my studies in Computer Science and Business Economics.

Currently, I'm interning at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) in Redmond, Washington on the Layout & Display team for Microsoft Word.

When I'm not sunbathing at the beach in sunny San Diego, you can probably find me...

- conducting research on [neurodevelopmental disorders](https://greenelab.ucsd.edu/)
- reading personal growth books -- reach out if you ever have any recs!
- trying to create the next best thing ðŸ˜Œ
