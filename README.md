### Hi, I'm Emily! 

I'm an undergraduate student at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/), pursuing my studies in Computer Science.

This last summer, I interned at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com/) as an Associate Product Manager (APM) on the BXP Sign Up Team. Previously, I have also worked on products at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) and [T-Mobile](https://tmobile.com/). 

When I'm not sunbathing at the beach in sunny San Diego, you can probably find me...

- conducting research on [neurodevelopmental disorders](https://greenelab.ucsd.edu/)
- reading personal growth books -- reach out if you ever have any recs!
- trying to create the next best thing ðŸ˜Œ
